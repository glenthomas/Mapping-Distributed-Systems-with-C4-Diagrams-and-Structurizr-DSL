Adopt Microservices Architecture\n\nDate: 2025-08-28\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nWe need to design a scalable e-commerce platform that can handle multiple domains including core e-commerce functionality, order fulfillment, and marketing automation. The system needs to support:\n\n- High availability and scalability\n- Independent deployment of different business capabilities\n- Different teams working on different parts of the system\n- Technology diversity for optimal solutions per domain\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will adopt a microservices architecture pattern, organizing our system into the following bounded contexts:\n\n1. **E-commerce System** - Core customer-facing functionality\n2. **Fulfillment System** - Order processing and inventory management\n3. **Marketing System** - Campaign management and customer engagement\n4. **Support System** - Customer service and support tools\n\nEach system will be composed of focused microservices with dedicated databases following the database-per-service pattern.\n\n## Consequences\n\n**Positive:**\n- Independent scaling of different business capabilities\n- Technology diversity - teams can choose optimal tech stack per service\n- Fault isolation - issues in one service don't bring down the entire system\n- Independent deployment and release cycles\n- Clear ownership boundaries for different teams\n\n**Negative:**\n- Increased operational complexity\n- Network latency between services\n- Data consistency challenges across services\n- More complex testing and debugging\n- Need for sophisticated monitoring and observability\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging\n- Use message queues for asynchronous communication\n- Establish clear service contracts and API versioning\n- Invest in CI/CD pipeline automation\n",

Use Polyglot Persistence Strategy\n\nDate: 2025-08-28\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nDifferent parts of our e-commerce platform have varying data requirements:\n\n- User accounts need ACID transactions and relational integrity\n- Product catalogs benefit from flexible schema and fast reads\n- Order data requires strong consistency and auditability\n- Marketing analytics need fast aggregations and flexible querying\n- Inventory tracking requires real-time updates and consistency\n\nA single database technology cannot optimally serve all these diverse needs.\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will implement a polyglot persistence strategy using different database technologies optimised for specific use cases:\n\n- **PostgreSQL** for transactional data (users, orders, campaigns, analytics)\n- **MongoDB** for flexible schema data (product catalogs, customer segments, inventory)\n- **MySQL** for warehouse operations data (established team expertise)\n\nEach microservice will own its data and database, following the database-per-service pattern.\n\n## Consequences\n\n**Positive:**\n- Optimal performance for each data access pattern\n- Services can evolve their data models independently\n- Technology choice matches team expertise and use case requirements\n- Better scalability through specialised database optimisations\n\n**Negative:**\n- Increased operational complexity managing multiple database technologies\n- Cross-service queries become more complex\n- Need for multiple database administration skills\n- Data consistency challenges across different database systems\n- Backup and disaster recovery complexity\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Implement robust monitoring for all database technologies\n- Use event-driven architecture for data synchronisation\n- Establish clear data ownership boundaries\n- Invest in database administration training and tooling\n",

Implement Event-Driven Architecture with Message Queues\n\nDate: 2025-08-28\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nOur microservices architecture requires reliable communication between services. We need to handle:\n\n- Order processing workflows that span multiple services\n- Real-time inventory updates across fulfillment and e-commerce systems\n- Marketing campaign triggers based on customer behavior\n- Asynchronous notifications and email sending\n- Decoupling of services to prevent cascading failures\n\nSynchronous API calls alone would create tight coupling and potential cascade failures.\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will implement event-driven architecture using message queues for asynchronous communication:\n\n- **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput event streaming (e-commerce and marketing systems)\n- **RabbitMQ** for reliable message delivery (fulfillment system)\n\nServices will publish domain events (order placed, payment processed, inventory updated) and subscribe to relevant events from other services.\n\n## Consequences\n\n**Positive:**\n- Loose coupling between services\n- Better resilience - services can handle temporary unavailability of dependencies\n- Scalability - async processing allows for better resource utilisation\n- Audit trail - events provide natural business process logging\n- Flexibility - new services can easily subscribe to existing events\n\n**Negative:**\n- Eventual consistency - data may be temporarily inconsistent across services\n- Complexity in handling message ordering and duplicate processing\n- Debugging distributed workflows becomes more challenging\n- Need for sophisticated monitoring of message queues\n- Potential message loss scenarios need handling\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Implement idempotent message handlers\n- Use message deduplication strategies\n- Establish clear event schemas and versioning\n- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting\n- Design for graceful degradation when message queues are unavailable\n",

Separate E-commerce and Fulfillment Systems\n\nDate: 2025-08-28\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nTraditional e-commerce architectures often tightly couple order management with fulfillment processes. However, we have identified distinct concerns:\n\n**E-commerce System Concerns:**\n- Customer experience and order capture\n- Product catalog management\n- Payment processing\n- User account management\n\n**Fulfillment System Concerns:**\n- Inventory management and reservations\n- Warehouse operations (picking, packing)\n- Shipping carrier integration\n- Order tracking and notifications\n\nThese domains have different scaling patterns, business rules, and operational requirements.\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will implement separate E-commerce and Fulfillment systems as distinct bounded contexts:\n\n**E-commerce System** will handle:\n- Customer-facing web application\n- Product catalog and search\n- Order placement and payment processing\n- Customer account management\n\n**Fulfillment System** will handle:\n- Order management and validation\n- Inventory tracking and reservations\n- Warehouse operations coordination\n- Shipping and delivery management\n\nCommunication between systems will be event-driven, with the E-commerce system publishing order events that the Fulfillment system consumes.\n\n## Consequences\n\n**Positive:**\n- Clear separation of business concerns and responsibilities\n- Independent scaling based on different usage patterns\n- Fulfillment system can serve multiple sales channels (web, mobile, B2B)\n- Different teams can own and optimise each system independently\n- Better fault isolation - fulfillment issues don't impact order placement\n- Easier integration with external fulfillment providers\n\n**Negative:**\n- More complex order-to-delivery workflow spanning systems\n- Eventual consistency between order status and fulfillment status\n- Need for sophisticated event handling and error recovery\n- More complex customer experience for order tracking\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Implement robust event-driven communication patterns\n- Design clear APIs for order status synchronisation\n- Use saga patterns for distributed transaction management\n- Provide unified customer experience through API composition\n",
