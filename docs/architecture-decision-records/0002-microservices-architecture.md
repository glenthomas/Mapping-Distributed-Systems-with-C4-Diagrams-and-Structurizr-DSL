# 2. Adopt Microservices Architecture

Date: 2025-08-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to design a scalable e-commerce platform that can handle multiple domains including core e-commerce functionality, order fulfillment, and marketing automation. The system needs to support:

- High availability and scalability
- Independent deployment of different business capabilities
- Different teams working on different parts of the system
- Technology diversity for optimal solutions per domain

## Decision

We will adopt a microservices architecture pattern, organizing our system into the following bounded contexts:

1. **E-commerce System** - Core customer-facing functionality
2. **Fulfillment System** - Order processing and inventory management
3. **Marketing System** - Campaign management and customer engagement
4. **Support System** - Customer service and support tools

Each system will be composed of focused microservices with dedicated databases following the database-per-service pattern.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Independent scaling of different business capabilities
- Technology diversity - teams can choose optimal tech stack per service
- Fault isolation - issues in one service don't bring down the entire system
- Independent deployment and release cycles
- Clear ownership boundaries for different teams

**Negative:**
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Data consistency challenges across services
- More complex testing and debugging
- Need for sophisticated monitoring and observability

**Mitigation:**
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Use message queues for asynchronous communication
- Establish clear service contracts and API versioning
- Invest in CI/CD pipeline automation
