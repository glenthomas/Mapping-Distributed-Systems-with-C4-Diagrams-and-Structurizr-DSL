# 9. Implement Dedicated Marketing System

Date: 2025-08-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Customer acquisition and retention require sophisticated marketing capabilities:

- Targeted email campaigns based on customer behavior
- Customer segmentation for personalsed marketing
- Campaign performance analytics and optimisation
- Integration with customer data from the e-commerce platform
- Marketing automation workflows

Initially considered building these features into the main e-commerce system, but identified distinct concerns and scaling patterns for marketing functionality.

## Decision

We will implement a dedicated Marketing System as a separate bounded context with the following capabilities:

**Core Services:**
- **Campaign Manager** - Create and manage marketing campaigns
- **Segmentation Service** - Customer segmentation and targeting
- **Email Campaign Service** - Marketing email delivery and tracking
- **Analytics Service** - Marketing performance analysis

**Key Features:**
- Customer data synchronisation with e-commerce system
- Automated campaign triggers based on customer behavior
- A/B testing for campaign optimisation
- Integration with external analytics providers

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Specialised focus on marketing automation and analytics
- Independent scaling based on campaign volumes
- Marketing team can work independently without impacting core e-commerce
- Better integration with marketing-specific tools and analytics
- Enables advanced features like predictive analytics and ML-driven segmentation
- Clear data ownership for marketing campaigns and customer insights

**Negative:**
- Additional system complexity and operational overhead
- Need for data synchronisation with e-commerce system
- Potential data consistency issues between systems
- More complex customer journey tracking across systems

**Mitigation:**
- Implement real-time event streaming for customer data synchronisation
- Use eventual consistency patterns with proper conflict resolution
- Establish clear data governance policies
- Implement comprehensive customer journey tracking across systems
- Use API gateways to provide unified customer experience
