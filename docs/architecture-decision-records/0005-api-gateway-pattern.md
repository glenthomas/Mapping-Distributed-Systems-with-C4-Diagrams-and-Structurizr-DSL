# 5. Use API Gateway Pattern

Date: 2025-08-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

With multiple microservices, we face challenges with:

- Client applications needing to know about multiple service endpoints
- Cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and logging
- Different API versions and protocols across services
- Security policies and access control
- Load balancing and service discovery

Direct client-to-service communication would create tight coupling and duplicate cross-cutting functionality.

## Decision

We will implement the API Gateway pattern using Spring Cloud Gateway for both e-commerce and marketing systems:

- Single entry point for all client API requests
- Handle cross-cutting concerns (authentication, rate limiting, CORS)
- Route requests to appropriate microservices
- API composition and protocol translation
- Request/response transformation and validation

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simplified client development - single endpoint to manage
- Centralised handling of cross-cutting concerns
- Better security through single controlled entry point
- Easier API versioning and backward compatibility
- Load balancing and failover capabilities
- Centralised logging and monitoring of API calls

**Negative:**
- Potential single point of failure
- Additional network hop adds latency
- Gateway becomes a bottleneck if not properly scaled
- Complexity in managing routing rules
- Risk of creating a distributed monolith if gateway becomes too intelligent

**Mitigation:**
- Implement high availability for API gateways
- Keep gateway logic lightweight - focus on routing and cross-cutting concerns
- Use circuit breakers to handle downstream service failures
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor gateway performance and scale horizontally as needed
