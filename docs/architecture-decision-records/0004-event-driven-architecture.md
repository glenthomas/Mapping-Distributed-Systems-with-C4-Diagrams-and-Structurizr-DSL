# 4. Implement Event-Driven Architecture with Message Queues

Date: 2025-08-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our microservices architecture requires reliable communication between services. We need to handle:

- Order processing workflows that span multiple services
- Real-time inventory updates across fulfillment and e-commerce systems
- Marketing campaign triggers based on customer behavior
- Asynchronous notifications and email sending
- Decoupling of services to prevent cascading failures

Synchronous API calls alone would create tight coupling and potential cascade failures.

## Decision

We will implement event-driven architecture using message queues for asynchronous communication:

- **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput event streaming (e-commerce and marketing systems)
- **RabbitMQ** for reliable message delivery (fulfillment system)

Services will publish domain events (order placed, payment processed, inventory updated) and subscribe to relevant events from other services.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Loose coupling between services
- Better resilience - services can handle temporary unavailability of dependencies
- Scalability - async processing allows for better resource utilisation
- Audit trail - events provide natural business process logging
- Flexibility - new services can easily subscribe to existing events

**Negative:**
- Eventual consistency - data may be temporarily inconsistent across services
- Complexity in handling message ordering and duplicate processing
- Debugging distributed workflows becomes more challenging
- Need for sophisticated monitoring of message queues
- Potential message loss scenarios need handling

**Mitigation:**
- Implement idempotent message handlers
- Use message deduplication strategies
- Establish clear event schemas and versioning
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Design for graceful degradation when message queues are unavailable
